          School transport facilities play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and security of
          students while providing an affordable means for them to commute to and from school. These

          Additionally, the buses are equipped with safety measures like seat belts, emergency
          exits, and first-aid kits, ensuring that students are protected throughout their journey.
          The drivers of these vehicles are carefully selected and undergo rigorous training in
          defensive driving and child safety, further enhancing the trust in these services.

          Furthermore, the affordability of school transport is a significant aspect that makes it
          accessible to a wider range of families. This inclusivity ensures that all students,
          regardless of their economic background, have equal access to education.

          The collective effort in providing a safe, secure, and affordable transportation system
          reflects the school’s commitment to student welfare and community well-being, making it an
          indispensable aspect of the educational experience.
